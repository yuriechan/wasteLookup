# Toronto Waste Lookup
A tool to look up proper disposal methods for waste items, with information sourced from the Toronto Waste Wizard Database(API).

## Motivation 
This app is created to help the citizens of Toronto, to easily look up for waste items and their disposal methods. <br>
It was created as part of the [Shopify Web Engineer Challenge (Summer 2019)](https://cdn.shopify.com/static/web-eng-challenge-summer-2019/index.md).

This app was initially created with jQuery and Node.js/Express, but I have decided to rewrite this app with React.js.<br>
The previous version of the source code is available inside `/legacy-app`.<br>
Or, click here for [my old repo on this waste look up with jQuery and Node.js/Express](https://github.com/yuriechan/shopify-summer-intern).

## A Learning Experience 
Using React.js helped me understand the MVVM design pattern, which is the foundation of this framework.
